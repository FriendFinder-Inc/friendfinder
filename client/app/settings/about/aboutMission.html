  <p class="c22"><span>Hi, I&rsquo;m Mike, and I created friendfinder. To give you a better understanding of what this website is and why I built it, I figured it might help to tell my story.</span></p>
    <p class="c22 c1"><span></span></p><br>
    <p class="c22"><span>After completing university in 2012, like many new graduates, I moved to a new city for a new job. I was extremely excited and optimistic, for it wasn&rsquo;t just any job I was starting. I was fortunate enough to be hired at Lucasfilm&rsquo;s visual effects studio, Industrial Light &amp; Magic. As a star wars fan, and tech geek in general, moving to San Francisco to work on Hollywood movies was a dream come true. There was one catch however. The position I was hired for required me to work the graveyard shift for the first 6 months, and then the second shift for the next year. ILM&rsquo;s render farm (which my team was responsible for) required 24/7 monitoring, and new hires had to work their way up the ladder and pay their dues by working the less desirable shifts. This to me was a small price to pay for getting my foot in the door at such an amazing company right out of school. </span></p>
    <p class="c22 c1"><span></span></p><br>
    <p class="c22"><span>However, the combination of moving across the country to a city where I knew nobody, and working these odd hours, made it much harder than I imagined to meet new people. It was nearly impossible to have a healthy social life (this is true for many people working in VFX, but that&rsquo;s another story) and my work/life balance was essentially nonexistent. I decided to make an active effort to change that and so I tried using popular websites such as meetup.com, okcupid, hinge, coffeemeetsbagel, etc - to name a few. Though these sites all have different &lsquo;vibes&rsquo;, they all have one thing in common - they are built to help people connect. I had varying degrees of &lsquo;success&rsquo; with all of them, but I won&rsquo;t get into that here. What I did realize from this experience however, is that the website that I wanted to use, to my surprise, didn&rsquo;t exist yet. I was just looking for a simple website, where users could post things that they wanted to do, and could be connected to other users that wanted to do those same things. Meetup.com was the closest to hitting that mark, but it is built primarily for ongoing groups of people to stay organized and plan events. It can actually be quite an impersonal experience depending on how large the group is and what the turnover rate is. </span></p>
    <p class="c22 c1"><span></span></p><br>
    <p class="c22"><span>One day, while taking the metro, I overheard a girl about my age talking with her friend. She told her friend that her favorite band played in town last week, and she was bummed she couldn&rsquo;t go because she didn&rsquo;t have anyone to go with. And then it hit me. How many other people are missing out on experiences, or not doing things that they want to, simply because none of their friends are available and they don&rsquo;t want to do it alone? How many other young people had the same experience I did, in realizing how much harder it is to meet new people and make new friends after college? As someone who has been fortunate enough to have acquired the skills needed to build a website, I felt I had an obligation to myself and my peers to try to solve this problem once and for all. </span></p>
    <p class="c22 c1"><span></span></p><br>
    <p class="c22"><span>I decided to take the following approach. Build a website that has nothing but the most basic and essential features needed to solve the problem, release it as soon as possible, and then using feedback from users, add more features and iterate. And after much work, as you can see, I&rsquo;ve achieved the first part of that goal. </span></p>
    <p class="c22 c1"><span></span></p><br>
    <p class="c22"><span>Though friendfinder was built primarily for myself and my peers (millennials), its truly a website for everyone. I remember back when facebook launched, and I was amazed at how easy it became to stay connected to my family and friends. It helped meet a very basic and human need that we all have; the need for community. The ability to stay and feel connected to the people that matter to us is extremely important. But just as important, is the desire to meet new people and expand our social network. This however, has never been the mission of facebook, and there are surprisingly few features to help you meet new people. What facebook does have however, is the information needed to help facilitate these types of interactions. Most of us meet new people in everyday life through friends, family, or coworkers usually in a natural and unplanned manner. We are (generally) more interested in meeting friends of our friends, than total strangers. Which is why I added the &lsquo;search by mutual friends&rsquo; feature to friendfinder. And what&rsquo;s even more exciting to me personally, is the ability to filter your results by &lsquo;degrees of connection&rsquo;. This works up to 7 degrees. So as more people join friendfinder, the connections between us all will be revealed to us for the first time! </span></p>
    <p class="c22 c1"><span></span></p><br>
    <p class="c22"><span>The ability to sort by &lsquo;mutual interests&rsquo; was also a crucial feature. All of the facebook pages you liked are pulled in by default when you signup, but users can also add custom tags, and even their meetup.com groups afterwords to make that feature even more powerful. The other filter options are there just to help you narrow your search to people you think you will most likely want to meet. </span></p>
    <p class="c22 c1"><span></span></p><br>
    <p class="c22"><span>I&rsquo;m very excited about this website. I think it could be the start of something great. It&rsquo;s a simple idea, but the possible impact it could have on our lives is immense. The ability for us all to explore our extended social network is powerful. Imagine a world in which people were more friendly and open to meeting new people? A world in which the excuse, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t have anyone to go with.&rsquo; is no longer an excuse for anything we want to do. A world in which loneliness and isolation are just problems with solutions, rather than byproducts of circumstance. That&rsquo;s the world I want to live in. Together, with your help, we can build an online community that shares this vision. Together, we can build something awesome.</span></p>
